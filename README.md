# Testing
## Validation Code
### HTML


The [W3C School HTML Validator](https://validator.w3.org/) 

![HTML Validator](assets/documentation/validator-html-home.png)

- I fixed errors accured during validation.
- On the [Home Page](assets/documentation/error-validator-html-home.png) there was an error in the credited code from CodePen, there was `<div>` element inside of `<b>` element. Also `<section>' were missing headings, so I added to the first section, and section with wow logo changed to `<figure>' element, and section with guide info chnaged to `<aside>`.
- On the [Compositions Page](assets/documentation/error-validator-html-comps.png) there was an error with `<p>` element without closing tag, so I removed it because during content implementation I haven't notice it.
- On the [Dungeons Page](assets/documentation/error-validator-html-dungs.png) there were errors with missing `<alt>` elements in the `<img>` element so I've add it, and warning with section without heading.
- On the [Contant Page](assets/documentation/error-validator-html-contact.png) there were errors with `<aria-placeholder>` and `<required>` element in the form so I removed it.

    * When entered the website I can see the tower of Torgast which is a feature of current World of Warcraft game, with World of Warcraft logo below. Easily readable text "Trying to achieve your first ever Keystone Master? You're in the right place!" interacting with me and increasing my engagement.

* As a First Time Visitor,  want to be able to easily navigate throughout the site to find content.

    * Navigation bar in the top of the page is easily accessable; Highlighted current page helps me understand where I currently am, and how does the interface work. Hovering over another item in the navbar highlights it.

    * Navigating throught the Navbar is very easy and intuitive both in desktop and mobile. Providing access to the Compositions, Dungeons and Contact pages.
### Returning Visitors Goals

* As a Returning Visitor, I want to find tips for certain boss fights.
    * As a Returning Visitor I follow the navigation bar to the dungeon page where I navigate among 8 dungeon image icons, which are familiar from the game, therefore I had no problem with finding the dungeon I am interested in.
    
* As a Returning Visitor, I want to find information about team compositions.
    * As a Returning Visitor I follow the navigation bar to the compositions page where suggested team compositions are listed.
* As a Returning Visitor, I want to find the community links to discord and form.
    * As a Returning Visitor I am familiar with the layout and noticed that discord link is provided in the footer throughtout the website. In order to fill in the form I need to navigate to the contact page where the form is.

## Further Testing 

 * The Website was tested on Google Chrome, Firefox and Miscrosoft Edge browsers. 
 * The website was viewed on a variety of devices such as Desktop, Laptop, Tablet- Samsung Tab 3, iPhone 12 Pro, iPhone 12 Pro Max.
 * Friends and family members were asked to review the site and documentation to point out any bugs and/or user experience issues. See the results below:
    * Initially on the Dungeons page navigation bar was below dungeon content, it has been reported that it wasn't intuitive and has been moved to the top of the page with css sticky position. 
    * Initially on the Compositions page on smaller screen size mobile users could have experience a situation in which they just had a wall of text on the entire screen. It has been addressed and right now, colourful composition icons are sticky to the top of the screen while reading about a certain composition keeping the screen entertaining.
    
    ![Compositions before after](assets/documentation/before-now-comp.png)

    * With testing on larger screens sizes I've noticed being able to highlight text that's part of estetic looks desing didn't leave the best experience. It has been noticed and addressed with user-select: none; for the text parts of website that serve as a visual design of the website. 
    * Initially on the Dungeons page navigation bar opacity restriction was only lifted while hovered. It had negative impact on identifying which of the dungeons is currently active. It has been addressed and currently the active link remains fully visible while browsing the page's contents.
